##  Data Mining

<!-- ```
dataMining != data-mining
``` -->

The manual extraction of patterns from data has occurred for centuries. The proliferation and increasing power of computers has dramatically increased data collection, storage, and manipulation ability.

* Bayes' theorem (1700s)
* Regression analysis (1800s).
* Automated data processing, neural networks, cluster analysis, genetic algorithms (1950s)
* Decision trees and decision rules (1960s)
* Support vector machines (1990s)

As data sets have grown in size and complexity, direct "hands-on" data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect,

Data mining is the process of applying these methods with the intention of uncovering hidden patterns in large data sets. It bridges the gap from applied statistics and artificial intelligence (which usually provide the mathematical background) to database management by exploiting the way data is stored and indexed in databases to execute the actual learning and discovery algorithms more efficiently, allowing such methods to be applied to ever larger data sets.

*The term is a misnomer, because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself.*

<!-- The actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining).

Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, but do belong to the overall knowledge discovery in database process as additional steps. -->
