![](resources/images/data/AutomatedFlowPipeline.svg.png) <!-- .element width="36%" -->

A data pipeline is a set of data processing elements connected in series, where the output of one element is the input of the next one. The elements of a pipeline are often executed in parallel or in time-sliced fashion; in that case, some amount of buffer storage is often inserted between elements.

A data pipeline encompasses the complete journey of data through the data lifecycle.
