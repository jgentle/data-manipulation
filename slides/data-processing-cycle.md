## The Data Processing Cycle

Data processing is the conversion of raw data to meaningful information through some kind of manipulation. Data is manipulated to produce outputs that provide insight to a problem. Data processing follows a cycle where inputs (raw data) are fed to a process (computer systems, software, etc.) to produce output (information and insights).

The data processing cycle consists of 6 phases:
- Collection
- Preparation
- Input
- Processing
- Output & Interpretation
- Storage
