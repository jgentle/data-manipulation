##  Data Management

*Data Management* is the development and execution of architectures, policies, practices and procedures in order to manage the information (data) lifecycle needs in an effective manner.

The concept of "Data Management" arose in the 1980s as technology moved from sequential processing (first cards, then tape) to random access processing.

<!-- Since it was now technically possible to store a single fact in a single place and access that using random access disk, some suggesting that "Data Management" was more important than "Process Management". During this period, random access processing was not competitively fast, so those suggesting "Process Management" was more important than "Data Management" used batch processing time as their primary argument. -->

As applications moved into real-time, interactive applications, it became obvious to most practitioners that both data and process management were important.

If the data is not well defined, the data will be mis-used in applications.

If the process isn't well defined, it is impossible to meet user needs.

<!-- To accomplish this, the data must go through a *Data Mining* process to extract useful information from it.

The data mining process is often implemented as a *Data Pipeline*.

However, it is important to start with the most basic understanding of the *Data Lifecycle*. -->
