##  Metadata & Documentation

Throughout the data lifecycle process, documentation must be updated to reflect actions taken upon the data. This includes acquisition, processing, and analysis, but may touch upon any stage of the lifecycle.

Updated and complete metadata are critical to maintaining data quality. The key distinction between metadata and documentation is that metadata, in the standard sense of "data about data," formally describes various key attributes of each data element or collection of elements, while documentation makes reference to data in the context of their use in specific systems, applications, settings.

Documentation also includes ancillary materials (e.g., field notes) from which metadata can be derived. In the former sense, it's "all about the data;" in the latter, it's "all about the use."
