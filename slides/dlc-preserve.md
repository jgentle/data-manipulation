##  DLC Phase 5: Preserve

Preservation involves actions and procedures to keep data for some period of time and/or to set data aside for future use, and includes data archiving and/or data submission to a data repository.

A primary goal for any data scientist or researcher is to preserve well-organized and documented datasets that support research interpretations that can be re-used by others.

All research publications should be supported by associated, accessible datasets (preferably with a minted DOI and linked data).
