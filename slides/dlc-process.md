##  DLC Phase 3: Process

Processing denotes actions or steps performed on data to verify, organize, transform, integrate, and extract data in an appropriate output form for subsequent use.

This includes data files and content organization, and data synthesis or integration, format transformations, and may include calibration activities (of sensors and other field and laboratory instrumentation).

Both raw and processed data require complete metadata to ensure that results can be duplicated.

Methods of processing must be rigorously documented to ensure the utility and integrity of the data.
