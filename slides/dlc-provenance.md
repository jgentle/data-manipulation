##  Provenance

Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes involved in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing that resource. Provenance provides a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions are a form of contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own provenance.

<!-- Provenance refers to the sources of information, such as entities and processes, involved in producing or delivering an artifact. The provenance of information is crucial to making determinations about whether information is trusted, how to integrate diverse information sources, and how to give credit to originators when reusing information. -->

Metadata is used to represent properties of objects. Many of those properties have to do with provenance. Descriptive metadata only becomes part of provenance when one also specifies its relationship to deriving an object. *Provenance is often represented as metadata, but not all metadata is necessarily provenance*.

*Trust* is derived from provenance information, and typically is a subjective judgment that depends on context and use. Provenance is effectively a platform for trust algorithms and approaches on the web.

Provenance information may be used for authentication purposes as well (ex. signature verification).
