The ability to prepare and issue, or disseminate, quality data to the public and to other researchers or data scientists is an important part of the lifecycle process.

We need to ensure that data are shared, but (ideally) with controls to protect proprietary and pre-decisional data and the integrity of the data itself.

Data sharing also requires complete metadata to be useful to those who are receiving the data.
