##  Quality Assurance & Management

Protocols and methods must be employed to ensure that data are properly collected, handled, processed, used, and maintained at all stages of the scientific data lifecycle.

This is commonly referred to as "QA/QC" or *Quality Assurance/Quality Control*.

QA focuses on building-in quality while QC focuses on testing for quality.
* QA makes sure you are doing the right things, the right way (e.g., prevent defects).
* QC makes sure the results of what you've done are what you expected (e.g., detecting defects).
