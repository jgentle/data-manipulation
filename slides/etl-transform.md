##  ETL: Transform

The transform step applies a set of rules to transform the data from the source to the target. This includes converting any measured data to the same dimension (i.e. conformed dimension) using the same units so that they can later be joined.

The transformation step also requires joining data from several sources, generating aggregates, generating surrogate keys, sorting, deriving new calculated values, and applying advanced validation rules.
