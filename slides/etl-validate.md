##  ETL: Validate

Validation is the process of assessing how well your mining models perform against real data. Data validation is fundamental to ensuring you have a reliable and reproducible ETL workflow.

There are many approaches for assessing the quality and characteristics of a data mining model. Common validation criteria for data include *accuracy, reliability, and usefulness*.

**Accuracy** is a measure of how well the model correlates an outcome with the attributes in the data that has been provided. There are various measures of accuracy, but all measures of accuracy are dependent on the data that is used.

**Reliability** assesses the way that a data mining model performs on different data sets. A data mining model is reliable if it generates the same type of predictions or finds the same general kinds of patterns regardless of the test data that is supplied.

**Usefulness** includes various metrics that tell you whether the model provides useful information. You might also find that a model that appears successful in fact is meaningless, because it is based on cross-correlations in the data.

Validation is commonly run after extraction (*post-extraction validation*), before load (*pre-load validation*) or after load (*post-load validation*).
